# Image Processing 101

Hello everybody, Alessandro here.

I've created this repo because during my journey of learning the
image processing with python I've encountered some obstacle.

First of all, I've switched few months ago from Linux to MacOS and
I had some problem to run all the stuff that are necessary to
use and learn the basics of the image processing.
Sadly in the lessons there are some errors, so this repo is here to help you.

In this repo you'll find an easy guide to setup your MacOS machine.

Beyond that, you'll se that in the root of the project there are
some files, every one of that files represent a lessons.

In every file you'll find the examples that are showed in the lessons and 
every one of that examples is working.
You just need to uncomment the code and run it.

The lessons to learn the basics are at this [link](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/01-introduction/index.html).


### Installation (For everybody)

That's it :call_me_hand:
